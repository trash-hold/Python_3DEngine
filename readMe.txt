Descend into madness

Overall things to think about:
    - implementation of mesh (probably triangles)
    - how to make detailed picture into terminal format 
Engine to do:
    1. Transformation (absolute -> relative ex camera)
    2. Depth scalling
    3. Projection
    4. Picture scalling and fixing 

Progess day 1:
    - found translation for moving CS by vector 
    - looking for rotation deriviation
